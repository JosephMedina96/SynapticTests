A repository testing out the Synaptic library, intended for neural networks.

**Synaptic is not owned by me, all rights go to their respective owners.**

**EDIT:** Found an extension library which is built on synaptic called neataptic.

============================================================================

To use any file:
1. Go to the desired folder (*each folder contains one test*).
2. Open the html file associated with that folder.
3. *Optional*: In browser, **right-click > inspect element** to check the files.

For clarifications sake, the only difference between the Javascript files is
the Web.js files are browser compatible.
