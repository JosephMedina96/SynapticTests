A repository testing out the Synaptic and Neataptic libraries, intended for neural networks.

**Synaptic and Neataptic are not owned by me, all rights go to their respective owners.**

**Synaptic:** https://github.com/cazala/synaptic

**Neataptic:** https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic

**EDIT:**

Added a section for [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Installation:

To utilize these files, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.  Go to the download link and find the version of node for your operating system.

**In node**

You can install synaptic with npm:

`npm install synaptic --save`

Similarly, you can install neataptic with npm:

`npm install neataptic`

You will also need to install jquery for future tests:

`npm install jquery`

**EDIT:**

To install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) follow the directions for one of the installation methods detailed in the link.

---

To use any Synaptic or Neataptic file:
1. Go to the desired folder (*each folder contains one test*).
2. Open the html file associated with that folder.
3. *Optional*: In browser, **right-click > inspect element** to check the files.

For clarifications sake, the only difference between the Javascript files is
the Web.js files are browser compatible.

---

To use any Tensorflow file:
1. Run the terminal or command line of your specific operating system
2. Navigate to the folder containing the Tensorflow files using the command *cd insertFilePathHere* (Replace "insertFilePathHere" with the actual file path)
3. Run the python file using the command *python nameOfFileHere.py* (Replace "nameOfFileHere" with actual file name)
