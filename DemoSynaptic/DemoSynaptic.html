		<h1>About the pop-ups...</h1>
		<p>Each of those was a test of a neural network that was designed to figure out XOR patterns.</p>

		<p>Test A was [0,0], which is not exclusive.</p>
		<p>Test B was [1,0], which is exclusive.</p>
		<p>Test B was [0,1], which is exclusive.</p>
		<p>Test D was [1,1], which is not exclusive.</p>

		<p>The network was able to accurately learn the pattern based on the limited training set it was given.</p>

		<p>For those interested in the code that is being tested:</p>
		<pre><code>		var testA = myPerceptron.activate([0,0]);
		var testB = myPerceptron.activate([1,0]);
		var testC = myPerceptron.activate([0,1]);
		var testD = myPerceptron.activate([1,1]);

		if (Math.round(testA) == 0) {
		  alert("Test A is correct.");
		} else {
		  alert("Test A is incorrect, more training required.");
		}

		if (Math.round(testB) == 1) {
		  alert("Test B is correct.");
		} else {
		  alert("Test B is incorrect, more training required.");
		}

		if (Math.round(testC) == 1) {
		  alert("Test C is correct.");
		} else {
		  alert("Test C is incorrect, more training required.");
		}

		if (Math.round(testD) == 0) {
		  alert("Test D is correct.");
		} else {
		  alert("Test D is incorrect, more training required.");
		}</code></pre>
